## Game Guide
To play the game, simply write down the actions you want to take. The possible commands are:

- Look: to get a description of the room.
- North, South, East and West: to move in the desired description. It only works if the room has an exit in this direction.
- Pick or Take (+ item name): to take a item that is in the current room.
- Put (+ item name) In or Into (+ item name): to put an item from the room inside another item you carry. Only works with bags.
- Drop: to drop an item. If it is inside a bag, you will also drop it.
- Inventory: to see what items you are currently carrying.
- Quit: to exit the game.
- Help: to get a list of this commands.

The game has no end goal. You just move around interacting with the item, while also watching the different animals doing their things and moving around. To exit the game at any time just write the command "quit".
